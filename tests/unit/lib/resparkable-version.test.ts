/**
 * Tests: Resparkable platform version constant
 *
 * `RESPARKABLE_VERSION` is Resparkable's source-of-truth for the platform version
 * (the public-surface contract lives in `VERSIONING.md`). This test defends
 * the one property the rest of the codebase relies on: the constant matches
 * a **valid SemVer MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH shape**, so anything consuming it
 * (the health endpoint payload, the eventual Hub discovery, CHANGELOG
 * tooling) can rely on the format without re-validating.
 *
 * An earlier draft also pinned the literal value (`'0.0.0'` during Phase 1)
 * to force the Phase-2 flip to be a deliberate, diff-visible change. That
 * pin was removed when v0.0.1 shipped — keeping it would make every future
 * release bump a release-cadence tax (the test would fail until a
 * maintainer updated the literal), and the SemVer-shape regex already
 * catches the realistic failure mode (a fork setting the constant to a
 * malformed string like 'unreleased' or '0.0').
 *
 * @see lib/resparkable-version.ts
 * @see VERSIONING.md
