/**
 * Tests: Fork's app version constant
 *
 * `APP_VERSION` is derived from `package.json.version` (the fork's app
 * version — distinct from `RESPARKABLE_VERSION` which is the upstream platform
 * version). Symmetric to `tests/unit/lib/resparkable-version.test.ts`.
 *
 * The single assertion here defends one property:
 *   - The constant matches a **valid SemVer 2.0.0 shape**, so anything
 *     consuming it (the health endpoint payload, analytics events, MCP
 *     server seeds via the sister `RESPARKABLE_VERSION`) can rely on the format
 *     without re-validating.
 *
 * There is NO Phase-1-placeholder-style fixed-value assertion here, because
 * the value is whatever the fork's `package.json.version` happens to be at
 * any moment — pinning it would couple the test to release cadence without
 * adding signal.
 *
 * @see lib/app-version.ts
 * @see VERSIONING.md
