/**
 * Email-change token discrimination (#489).
 *
 * better-auth routes an email CHANGE through the same two callbacks as a normal
 * signup verification — `emailVerification.sendVerificationEmail` and
 * `emailVerification.afterEmailVerification` — and neither callback's arguments
 * carry a flag saying which flow it is. Worse, during a change the `user.email`
 * handed to `sendVerificationEmail` is already the NEW address while the DB row
 * still holds the old one, so the obvious "compare against the DB" test is
 * misleading rather than merely absent.
 *
 * The reliable discriminator is the token. better-auth mints it as an HS256 JWT
 * and the payload shape differs by flow:
 *
 *   signup / resend  →  { email }
 *   email change     →  { email: <OLD>, updateTo: <NEW>, requestType: 'change-email-…' }
 *
 * So `updateTo` both identifies the flow and hands back the previous address —
 * which is exactly what the old-address notification and the session revocation
 * need, and what neither callback otherwise provides.
 *
 * This matters because both shared hooks do something that is wrong for a
 * change: `sendVerificationEmailHook` skips sending when the target address has
 * a pending invitation (correct for signup, but it would strand a change), and
 * `afterEmailVerificationHook` sends the welcome email (correct for signup,
 * absurd for an established user who just moved address).
 *
 * @see lib/auth/config.ts · .context/auth/security.md

 * whether we revoke sessions, and a helper that silently trusted an unverified
 * payload would be a trap for the next caller who reaches for it in a context
 * where the token is genuinely untrusted.
 *
 * Never throws: a malformed or unverifiable token resolves to `null`, which
