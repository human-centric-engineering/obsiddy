/**
 * Email template resolver — per-kind override + platform fallback.
 *
 * Platform call sites render auth emails through {@link resolveEmailTemplate}
 * instead of importing a template directly, so a fork can swap any email's copy
 * by registering a component in `lib/app/emails.ts` while the platform defaults
 * serve the rest. The defaults in `emails/*` stay untouched as living reference
 * implementations a fork copies into `components/app/emails/*` and adapts.
 *
 * **Props contract:** {@link EmailPropsMap} is the stable, typed contract per
 * email kind — the same shape the platform passes and an override must accept.
 * Changing a kind's props is therefore a versioned public-surface change
 * (CHANGELOG). The `defaultTemplates` assignment below type-checks that each
 * shipped template matches its contract, so drift fails the build.

/**
 * The typed props contract per email kind. Keys are the {@link EmailKind}
 * union; each value is exactly what the platform passes to that template and
 * what an override must accept.
 *
 * ## Adding your own email kind (forks)
 *
 * This is an `interface`, so a fork **adds** kinds by declaration merging — no
 * edit to this file, nothing to conflict on upgrade. Declare the merge and the
 * template in your own module:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // lib/app/emails.ts (or any module your app loads)
 * declare module '@/lib/email/registry' {
 *   interface EmailPropsMap {
 *     'app.invoiceReceipt': { userName: string; invoiceUrl: string; total: string };
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * export const emailOverrides: EmailOverrides = {
 *   'app.invoiceReceipt': InvoiceReceiptEmail,
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * `EmailKind`, `EmailOverrides` and `resolveEmailTemplate` all widen with it, so
 * `resolveEmailTemplate('app.invoiceReceipt', props)` is type-checked against
 * your declared props. Namespace your keys `app.` / `framework.` to match the
 * reserved tiers in CUSTOMIZATION.md and guarantee no collision with a kind a
 * future Sunrise release adds.
 *
 * A fork-added kind has no platform default — it exists only in
 * `emailOverrides` — which is why `defaultTemplates` below is `Partial` and
 * `resolveEmailTemplate` throws for a kind with neither. See #468.
