## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in Resparkable, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report security issues privately:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred):
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/human-centric-engineering/sunrise/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Varies by severity (critical issues prioritized)

### Security Best Practices for Resparkable Users

When deploying Resparkable in production:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Never commit `.env.local` or `.env.production` to version control
   - Use strong, randomly-generated secrets for `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Database**:
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict database access to application servers only
   - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Dependabot opens weekly update PRs automatically; enable "Dependabot security updates" in repo settings for vulnerability-driven PRs
   - CodeQL, dependency review, and secret scanning run in CI (see `.github/workflows/`)
   - Run `npm audit` locally for ad-hoc checks

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Configure appropriate rate limits for your use case (see `lib/security/rate-limit.ts`)
   - Use Redis for distributed rate limiting in production

5. **Headers & CORS**:
   - Review security headers in `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's renamed middleware)
   - Configure CORS appropriately for your domain

6. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable error tracking (Sentry is pre-configured)
   - Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns

### Known Security Features

Resparkable includes these security features out of the box:

- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- CSRF protection via better-auth
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt via better-auth)
- Input validation with Zod
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- SQL injection protection via Prisma
- XSS protection via React and input sanitization
- Supply-chain scanning in CI: automated dependency updates (Dependabot), PR vulnerability gating (dependency review), static analysis (CodeQL), and secret scanning (TruffleHog)

### Acknowledgments

We appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution in our release notes.
